// This macro function calls the C runtime's _beginthreadex function. 
// The C runtime library doesn't want to have any reliance on Windows' data 
// types such as HANDLE. This means that a Windows programmer needs to cast
// values when using _beginthreadex. Since this is terribly inconvenient, 
// I created this macro to perform the casting.
